# Xojo-Project-Opener

Opens Xojo project files with the correct version.  Currently Windows Only.

Set as default program for .xojo_xml_project and .xojo_binary_project

It will detect the version required and automatically open it.  If the required version is not installed it will pop up a list of versions that are installed, and clicking one launches xojo with the file.  If no file is parsed it just shows the list of available Xojo's.
